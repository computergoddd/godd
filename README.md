<b> Hi, I'm Tomiwa <b>

I'm a self taught software engineer and pentester from Lagos,Nigeria striving to innovate great solutions to modern-day problems. I specialize in digital design, ethical hacking and development, but any activity requiring problem solving and creative thinking is where you will find me.

Currently contracted as a Software Engineer and Platform Engineer & Designer @ 96 Solutions, while maintaining previous client's (startups and established companies) websites through my sole proprietorship and working on personal projects in my spare time.

~ I wish I did more open source work, and I'll try my best to get more into it in the near future.
Personal projects I'm currently working on and maintaining.

Where you'll find me
